# Physics Informed Neural Network - PINN

This repo contains working code implementation of paper [Physics-informed neural networks: A deep learning framework for solving forward and inverse problems involving nonlinear partial differential equations](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2018.10.045). 

The code is built using pytorch package

One can refer original implementation of PINN [here](https://github.com/maziarraissi/PINNs)
