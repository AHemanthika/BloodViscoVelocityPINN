#  BloodViscoVelocityPINN - A Physics-informed Neural Network to Estimate Blood Flow Velocity, Viscosity and Density Using Blood Pressure Data. 

This repo contains working code implementation BloodViscoVelocityPINN model. This work is inspired from paper [Physics-informed neural networks: A deep learning framework for solving forward and inverse problems involving nonlinear partial differential equations](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2018.10.045). 

The code is built using pytorch package in python. Refer Report.pdf to get gist of the work.

One can refer original implementation of PINN [here](https://github.com/maziarraissi/PINNs)
